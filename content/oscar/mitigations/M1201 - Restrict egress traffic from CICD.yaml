summary: Restrict egress traffic in CI/CD
description: |
  Restrict egress traffic from the build system to authorized destinations. This is pretty straightforward and a very feasible mitigation since a build system usually requires access to a very limited destinations.
  Controlling the traffic has many benefits:
  1. Prevent exfiltration of sensitive information
  2. Block download of packages from unauthorized package repositories
  3. Block download of malware
