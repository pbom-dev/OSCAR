summary: Store credentials in vault
description: |
  Sensitive data like credentials and API tokens should not be stored directly in code. 
  Modern applications talk to many third-party APIs, SaaS solutions and other dependencies. 
  This integration usually requires an API token, username & password credential or other similar variable.  
  Sometimes these sensitive credentials include database host strings or hostnames.  
  All of these credentials should not be stored directly in code.   
  Software engineers often don't understand the consequences of embedding these credentials in code.
  This is especially true for Javascript applications that run client side as these credentials are often visible by inspecting the Javascript files running in the local browser
