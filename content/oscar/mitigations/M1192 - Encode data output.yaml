summary: Encode data output
description: |
  Output Encoding is recommended when you need to safely display data exactly as a user typed it in. 
  Variables should not be interpreted as code instead of text.
  Use default output encoding protection when you wish to display data as the user typed it in. Automatic encoding and escaping functions are built into most frameworks.
  If you are not using a framework or need to cover gaps in the framework then you should use an output encoding library. 
  Each variable used in the user interface should be passed through an output encoding function.
