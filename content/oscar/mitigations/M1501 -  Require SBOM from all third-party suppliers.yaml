summary: Require SBOM from all third-party suppliers
description: |
  An SBOM for every third-party artifact helps to ensure an artifact is safe to use and fully compliant. 
  This file lists all important metadata, especially all the dependencies of an artifact, and allows for verification of each dependency. 
  If one of the dependencies/artifacts is attacked or has a new vulnerability (e.g., the “SolarWinds” or even “log4j” attack), it is easier to detect what has been affected by this incident because dependencies in use are listed in the SBOM file
