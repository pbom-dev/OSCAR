summary: Use parametrization with input validation
description: |
  If calling a system command that incorporates user-supplied cannot be avoided, the following two layers of defense should be used within software to prevent attacks.
  1. Parametrization: If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and command. These mechanisms can help provide the relevant quoting and encoding.
  2. Input validation: The values for commands and the relevant arguments should be both validated. There are different degrees of validation for the actual command and its arguments.
  When it comes to the commands used, these must be validated against a list of allowed commands.
