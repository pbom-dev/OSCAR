summary: Avoid calling OS commands directly
description: |
  Built-in library functions are a very good alternative to OS Commands, as they cannot be manipulated to perform tasks other than those it is intended to do.
  For example use mkdir() instead of system("mkdir /dir_name").
  If there are available libraries or APIs for the language you use, this is the preferred method.
