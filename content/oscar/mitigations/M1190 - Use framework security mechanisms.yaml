summary: Use framework security mechanisms
description: |
  Fewer XSS bugs appear in applications built with modern web frameworks. 
  These frameworks steer developers towards good security practices and help mitigate XSS by using templating, auto-escaping, and more.
  Understand how your framework prevents XSS and where it has gaps. 
  There will be times where you need to do something outside the protection provided by your framework. 
  This is where Output Encoding and HTML Sanitization are critical.
