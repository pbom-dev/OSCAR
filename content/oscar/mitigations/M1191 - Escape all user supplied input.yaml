  All user data controlled must be encoded when returned in the HTML page to prevent the execution of malicious data.
  The type of encoding is specific to the context of the page where the user controlled data is inserted. 
  For example, HTML entity encoding is appropriate for data placed into the HTML body. 
  However, user data placed into a script would need JavaScript specific output encoding.
