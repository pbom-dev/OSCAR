summary:  Use a self-managed artifact registry
description: |
    A local artifact registry can be used for storing open source software packages and also store any artifact that is produced by the CI/CD system. Self-managed artifact registries provide advanced security features such as access control, encryption, and digital signatures. This ensures that your software artifacts are protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or distribution.
