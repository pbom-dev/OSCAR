summary: Enable data sencryption in transit
description: |
  Data encryption in transit is a critical security control in cloud computing that involves encrypting data as it moves between two points over a network or the internet. This is important to prevent data breaches, protect sensitive data, and comply with data privacy regulations. 
  Cloud service providers use various encryption protocols to establish a secure communication channel, and organizations should ensure that encryption is properly implemented and verified.
  To implement data encryption in transit, cloud service providers use various encryption protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). 
  These protocols use encryption keys and digital certificates to establish a secure communication channel between the sender and receiver. 
  The encryption process ensures that data is scrambled and unreadable to anyone without the proper decryption key.
  Check your cloud provider documentation for more details on how to enable data encryption in transit.
