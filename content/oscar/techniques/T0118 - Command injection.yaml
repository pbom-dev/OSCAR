summary: Command injection

description: |
    OS command injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server that is running an application.
    Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. 
    In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. 
    Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation

mitigations:
  - M1180
  - M1181
  - Applications should run using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks
  - If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task

detections:
  - D1170
