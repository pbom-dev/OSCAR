summary: Dependency Confusion
description: |
    Dependency confusion is a type of supply chain attack that occurs when an attacker exploits the way some package managers, such as npm and PyPI, resolve dependencies when installing software libraries.
    In a typical software development project, developers rely on a variety of external libraries, often referred to as dependencies, to build their applications. These libraries are typically stored in a remote repository, and developers use a package manager to install and manage them. An attacker will utilize prior knowledge of usage of dependencies (*Discover used open-source dependencies*) to upload a malicious package with the same name to a public repository. This might "confuse" package managers to use to public resource instead of the local one - thus executing or infecting the CI/CD. This can happen on the developer's machine or the build system and has the potential to further steps of an attack - for example, if the malicious code exfiltrate an access token to production environment

mitigations:
# reference to mitigation references
    - M1200
    - Harden package mainfest. Never leave a package with no specific version
    - Use a locally manage repository and make sure to enforece its usage
