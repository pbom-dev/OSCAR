summary: Active scanning

description: |
  This technique involves actively scanning an organization's cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause system disruption.
  An attacker can use this technique to identify vulnerable assets within an organization's cloud infrastructure and develop an understanding of the target's attack surface. 
  By conducting active scanning, an attacker can gather information about an organization's network topology, application architecture, and security controls, and use this information to plan and execute more effective attacks.
