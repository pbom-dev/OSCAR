summary: Cross-site scripting

description: |
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable applications.
    XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. 
    An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. 
    The end user browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. 
    These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
