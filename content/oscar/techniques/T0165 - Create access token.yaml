summary: Create access token
description: |
    Following initial access, an attacker may attempt to create alternative means of access to the system that was infiltrated. Since the initial access may use a temporary or temporary session token - a common adversary technique would be to create an access token which will persist the access to the system. For example, after getting an initail access by abusing a compromised 2FA backed session token an attacker created access tokens that allowed both persistance and lateral movement (Circle CI reference)
mitigations:
  - Network segmentation: If possible, limit sensitive actions to specific network segments. 
  - Follow least privelages methodology: Limit the number of users with high permissions and/or ability to perform sensitive actions
  - Audit sensitive operations
  - 2FA for sensitive operations: Even if a user passed 2FA, for every sensitive operation they would need to re-authenticate

detections: 
  - Audit rogue creation of API credentials
