summary: Create access token

description: |
  Following initial access, an attacker may attempt to create alternative means of access to the system that was infiltrated. 
  Since the initial access may use a temporary or temporary session token - a common adversary technique would be to create an access token which will persist the access to the system. For example, after getting an initail access by abusing a compromised 2FA backed session token an attacker created access tokens that allowed both persistance and lateral movement (Circle CI reference)
