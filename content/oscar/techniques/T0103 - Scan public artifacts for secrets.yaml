summary: Scan public artifacts for secrets

description: |
  This technique involves scanning publicly available artifacts, such as code repositories and container images, for sensitive information such as passwords, access keys, and other secrets. 
  By scanning these artifacts, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application or underlying system and potentially cause significant damage.
  For example, an attacker might use this technique to scan a public code repository for hardcoded passwords or access keys, which could then be used to gain unauthorized access to the application or the underlying system. 
  Alternatively, an attacker might scan a public container image for sensitive information such as database credentials, which could be used to gain access to sensitive data.
