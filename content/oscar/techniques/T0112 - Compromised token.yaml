summary: Compromised token

description: |
    Access to third party APIs typically uses a token to authenticate acces.  
    This token is usually a randomized string that is auto-generated by the API provider and should be at least 16 characters or more.  
    This token is passed with a request to the API provider and if the token is valid, the request is successful.  
    Each of these tokens will usually have a set of permissions applied to it that authorizes it to perform very simple read operations, or more complex write and delete operations.  
    Unfortunately, these tokens are often accidentally embedded in applications via source code or Javascript variable exposure.  
    Attackers will often scan web applications URLs or public git repositories for exposed credentials to then in turn use those found credentials to gain access to the victims resources.
