summary: Publish malicious artifact

description: |
  Public registries are widely used by developers and organizations to download and distribute software packages and container images, making them an attractive target for attackers.
  In this type of attack, the attacker creates a package or container image that contains malicious code or files, such as a backdoor or other malware. 
  The attacker then uploads the package or image to PyPI, DockerHub or other registry, posing as a legitimate user or creating a fake account. 
  Once the package or image is uploaded, it becomes available for download by other users who may unsuspectingly use it in their projects.
  The supply chain attack can have far-reaching consequences as it can affect all systems that rely on the malicious package or image. 
  For example, a Python package that is downloaded from PyPI may be used by multiple applications and libraries, potentially compromising all systems that use it.
  Similarly, a container image with a malicious payload may be used to deploy an application across multiple environments, leading to a widespread compromise.
