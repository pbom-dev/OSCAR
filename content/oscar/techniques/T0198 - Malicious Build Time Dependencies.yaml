summary: Malicious Build Time Dependencies

description: |
  Within the CI/CD workflow, code can be pushed at different stages. During the build process, plugins are often utilized for tasks like building and testing. However, if a third-party plugin is compromised, malicious code can be introduced. For instance, an attacker gains control over a Maven plugin (a popular build framework) and inject malware during the build process. SBOM tools may not be effective in detecting such scenarios as they primarily operate on source code.
