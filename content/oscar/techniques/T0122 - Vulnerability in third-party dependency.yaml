summary: Vulnerability in third-party CI/CD actions

description: | 
  The use of 3rd party Github actions is very common. 
  Similar to using 3rd party libraries this can also introduce security risks - a malicious Github action has access to very sensitive information - i.e exfiltrating environment variables, including backdoors or malware in source code, infecting build artifacts.
