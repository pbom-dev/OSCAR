                A 3CX employee desktop is infected with the trojanized X_TRADER software. There is evidence that the vendor site was compromised and infected with an exploit kit that distributed the trojanized software

              3CX used to save their application password unencrypted/unhashed in the file system. It is not clear if that was used as part of this attack, but the fact is that they released a new client that resolves this issue.

      comment: |
              The EDR (if it existed) didn't detect malware on the desktop. The build system was not hardened (network/application). Code scanning tools didn't exist/were not configured correctly/nobody looked into the results.

              Access and changes to the build system and content should have been logged and alerted upon.
