        These phishing attempts were successful on at least two occasions, targeting version 0.1.6 of "exotel" (with over 480,000 total downloads) and versions 2.0.2 and 4.0.2 of "spam" (with over 200,000 total downloads). The malicious code was crafted to pilfer cryptocurrency credentials and was later augmented with a broader functionality aimed at stealing Chrome passwords
