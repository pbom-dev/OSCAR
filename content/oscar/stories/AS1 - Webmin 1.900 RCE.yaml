summary: Webmin 1.900 RCE
description: |
        Webmin, a widely used server administration software, experienced a security incident where attackers introduced a backdoor into version 1.890. This backdoor allowed individuals with knowledge of it to execute commands with root privileges. Subsequent versions, 1.900 to 1.920, also contained a similar backdoor in the code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin installation. Only if an administrator had specifically enabled the "changing of expired passwords" feature in the Webmin Configuration ⇾ Authentication section, could it be utilized by an attacker. These vulnerabilities were not accidental flaws; rather, the Webmin source code was deliberately modified to include a concealed vulnerability.

              The webmin build server was apperantly explioitable and the attackers used this to repeat the attack. 
              *"On September 10th 2018, the vulnerable build server was decomissioned and replaced with a newly installed server running CentOS 7. However, the build directory containing the modified file was copied across from backups made on the original server."*
