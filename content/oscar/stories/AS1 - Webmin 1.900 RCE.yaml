summary: Webmin 1.900 RCE
description: |
        Webmin, a widely used server administration software, experienced a security incident where attackers introduced a backdoor into version 1.890. This backdoor allowed individuals with knowledge of it to execute commands with root privileges. Subsequent versions, 1.900 to 1.920, also contained a similar backdoor in the code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin installation. Only if an administrator had specifically enabled the "changing of expired passwords" feature in the Webmin Configuration â‡¾ Authentication section, could it be utilized by an attacker. These vulnerabilities were not accidental flaws; rather, the Webmin source code was deliberately modified to include a concealed vulnerability.

                At some time in April 2018, the Webmin development build server was exploited and a vulnerability added to the password_change.cgi script. According to their official writeup. The code that was integrated was taken from the local system and not from a controlled SCM.

              The Webmin build server was apparently exploitable and the attackers used this to repeat the attack. 
              "On September 10th 2018, the vulnerable build server was decommissioned and replaced with a newly installed server running CentOS 7. However, the build directory containing the modified file was copied across from backups made on the original server."
