summary: Webmin 1.900 RCE
description: |
        Webmin is a popular server administration software. Webmin version 1.890 was released with a backdoor that could allow anyone with knowledge of it to execute commands as root. Versions 1.900 to 1.920 also contained a backdoor using similar code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin install. Only if the admin had enabled the feature at Webmin ⇾ Webmin Configuration ⇾ Authentication to allow changing of expired passwords could it be used by an attacker.
        Neither of these were accidental bugs - rather, the Webmin source code had been maliciously modified to add a non-obvious vulnerability.

                At some time in April 2018, the Webmin development build server was exploited and a vulnerability added to the password_change.cgi script. According to their official writeup. The code that was integrated was taken from the local system and not from a controlled SCM.

              The webmin build server was apperantly explioitable and the attackers used this to repeat the attack. 
              *"On September 10th 2018, the vulnerable build server was decomissioned and replaced with a newly installed server running CentOS 7. However, the build directory containing the modified file was copied across from backups made on the original server."*
