summary: Webmin 1.900 RCE
description: |
        Webmin is a popular server administration software. Webmin version 1.890 was released with a backdoor that could allow anyone with knowledge of it to execute commands as root. Versions 1.900 to 1.920 also contained a backdoor using similar code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin install. Only if the admin had enabled the feature at Webmin ⇾ Webmin Configuration ⇾ Authentication to allow changing of expired passwords could it be used by an attacker.
        Neither of these were accidental bugs - rather, the Webmin source code had been maliciously modified to add a non-obvious vulnerability.

                At some time in April 2018, the Webmin development build server was exploited and a vulnerability added to the password_change.cgi script. According to their official writeup. The code that was integrated was taken from the local system and not from a controlled SCM.

              The Webmin build server was apparently exploitable and the attackers used this to repeat the attack. 
              "On September 10th 2018, the vulnerable build server was decommissioned and replaced with a newly installed server running CentOS 7. However, the build directory containing the modified file was copied across from backups made on the original server."
