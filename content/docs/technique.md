title: "Technique"
description: "Techniques represent "how" an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. For example, an adversary create a backdoor in third party software used within the organization's supply chain. Techniques may also represent "what" an adversary gains by
performing an action. This is a useful distinction for the Discovery tactic as the techniques highlight what type of information an adversary is after with a particular action. 

Sub-techniques further break down behaviors described by techniques into more specific descriptions of how behavior is used to achieve an objective. For example, with backdoor added to third party code, the adversary would need to become a maintainer of the third party library or masquerade the backdoor within a potentially legitimate pull request.

There may be many ways, or techniques, to achieve tactical objectives, so there are multiple
techniques in each tactic category. Likewise, there may be multiple ways to perform a technique
so there can be multiple distinct sub-techniques under a technique."

## The structure of a technique

**The Syntax**
```YAML

id: # REQUIRED - <key:value> prefix with T,M,D - example T1123
type: # REQUIRED - <key:value> choose one of the following: Technique,Mitigation,Detection
tactic: # REQUIRED - <list> - choose at least one technique
realm: # REQUIRED - <list> - multiple choice
summary: # REQUIRED - <key:value>
description: # REQUIRED - <key:value> - supports markdown
mitigations: # REQUIRED - <list> -reference to mitigation references
detections: # REQUIRED - <list> - reference to detection definitions
subTechniques: # OPTIONAL <list> - reference to techniqueIDs
references: # OPTIONAL <list> - reference to attacks, articles, blogs etc...
metadata:
  state: # REQUIRED <key:value> choose  draft or release
  version: # OPTIONAL <key:value> note a version number of this document

```

**Example:**

```YAML
id: T0120
type: Technique
tactic: Initial Access
realm:
    - Container Security
    - Open Source Security
    - Artifact Security
summary: Dependency Confusion
description: |
    Dependency confusion is a type of supply chain attack that occurs when an attacker exploits the way some package managers, such as npm and PyPI, resolve dependencies when installing software libraries.
    In a typical software development project, developers rely on a variety of external libraries, often referred to as dependencies, to build their applications. These libraries are typically stored in a remote repository, and developers use a package manager to install and manage them. An attacker will utilize prior knowledge of usage of dependencies (*Discover used open-source dependencies*) to upload a malicious package with the same name to a public repository. This might "confuse" package managers to use to public resource instead of the local one - thus executing or infecting the CI/CD. This can happen on the developer's machine or the build system and has the potential to further steps of an attack - for example, if the malicious code exfiltrate an access token to production environment
