# Contributing to OSC&R

We would love for you to contribute to the OSC&R project and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
 - [Coding Rules](#rules)
 - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)
 - [Signing the CLA](#cla)


## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep OSC&R open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using our [Slack Channel](https://osc-r.slack.com/) to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to [Slack](https://osc-r.slack.com/).


## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug / logical flaw / missing link in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.


## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature / technique / control?
You can *request* an addition by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new addition to the model, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major addition**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

  **Note**: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

* **Small additions** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).


## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="signing-code"></a> Code Signing

Code signing is mandatory to make a contribution to OCS&R. Learn more about how to sign code in the following article [About commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

Commits that are not signed will not be approved and merged.

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues / add more content as soon as possible, but before adding anything, we would like to confirm it aligns with the OSC&R patterns and presents itself as a beneficial addition to the model.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/pbom-dev/OSCAR/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.


### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/pbom-dev/OSCAR/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you are fixing, or documents the design for the addition you would like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we are ready to accept your work.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the pbom-dev/OSCAR repo.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
     ```

5. Create your content,
 
7. Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).

8. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit).
   Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git commit --all
     ```
    Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

9.  Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `OSCAR:main`.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

The OSC&R team reserves the right not to accept pull requests from community members who have not been good citizens of the community. Such behavior includes not following the [OSC&R code of conduct](https://github.com/pbom-dev/OSCAR/code-of-conduct) and applies within or outside of OSC&R managed channels.

#### Addressing review feedback

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. Make the required updates to the code.

2. Create a fixup commit and push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git commit --all --fixup HEAD
    git push
    ```

    For more info on working with fixup commits see [here](docs/FIXUP_COMMITS.md).

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!


##### Updating the commit message

A reviewer might often suggest changes to a commit message (for example, to add more context for a change or adhere to our [commit message guidelines](#commit)).
In order to update the commit message of the last commit on your branch:

1. Check out your branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout my-fix-branch
    ```

2. Amend the last commit and modify the commit message:

    ```shell
    git commit --amend
    ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository:

    ```shell
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```

> NOTE:<br />
> If you need to update the commit message of an earlier commit, you can use `git rebase` in interactive mode.
> See the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) for more details.


#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the main branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout main -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream main
    ```

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Format

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.


```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".
When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.


#### <a name="commit-header"></a>Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: technique|mitigation|process|tactic|category|documentation|data-source
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: addition|fix|update|deletion
```

The `<type>`, `<summary>`, and `(<scope>)` fields are all mandatory.


##### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **addition**: An addition to the model that had not existed beforehand
* **fix**: A fix to already existing content that is ***not accurate***
* **update**: update to already existing content that incldues more information, changes in the pattern across the industry etc.
* **deletion**: removal of content from the model that is no longer needed, deprecated or mistakenly added.

##### Scope
The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

* `technique`
* `mitigation`
* `process`
* `tactic`
* `category`
* `data-source`


##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end


#### <a name="commit-body"></a>Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.


#### <a name="commit-footer"></a>Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.
For example:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK LINE>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Closes #<pr number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase "BREAKING CHANGE: " followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with "DEPRECATED: " followed by a short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.


### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
